# Lars Kasper, PhD  
Lead MR Physicist, Toronto Neuroimaging Facility (ToNI)  
Department of Psychology, University of Toronto  

This is my academic CV. My personal story through the lens of MRI can be found in this [ISMRM Member Spotlight](https://www.ismrm.org/member-spotlight/lars-kasper/) from 2023.

## Brief Academic Bio
Lars received his PhD in Biomedical Engineering from ETH Zurich (Switzerland) in 2014, with a work on "Noise Reduction in fMRI Utilizing Concurrent Magnetic Field Monitoring". During his postdoctoral research in the MR Methods and Technology Group (Klaas Pruessmann) and Translational Neuromodeling Unit (Klaas Stephan) in Zurich, Lars was working at the interface between cutting-edge imaging concepts and their applications in computational neuroscience and psychiatry. In particular, Lars' projects included ultra-high field spiral MRI and NMR-probe based field monitoring in the context of fMRI, as well as laminar fMRI applications to investigate prediction error signaling according to the Bayesian Brain hypothesis.
 
From 2020 to 2023, Lars was a scientific associate in Kamil Uludag's lab for Brain Research in Advanced Imaging and Neuromodeling - Toronto (BRAIN-TO), focusing on the translation of promising MR sequence and reconstruction concepts into the clinics, e.g., for spiral diffusion MRI.

Currently, Lars is the Lead MR Physicist of the [Toronto Neuroimaging Facility (ToNI)](https://toni.psych.utoronto.ca), overseeing operations of the facility that hosts a state-of-the-art Siemens 3T Prisma MRI and is highly specialized on functional imaging for cognitive neuroscience and psychiatric applications.
