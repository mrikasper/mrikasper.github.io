## Welcome!

I am an MR physicist specializing in **fMRI**, with a particular focus on **physiological noise correction**, **magnetic field monitoring**, and **image reconstruction**. Currently, I am the **Lead MR Physicist** at the **[Toronto Neuroimaging Facility (ToNI)](https://toni.psych.utoronto.ca/)** in the Department of Psychology, University of Toronto.

My personal story through the lens of MRI can be found in this [ISMRM Member Spotlight](https://www.ismrm.org/member-spotlight/lars-kasper/) from 2023.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on adapting state of the art advances in MR imaging methodology in the context of neuroscientific and translational MRI applications, Therein, I aim at increasing sensitivity from both angles, i.e., maximizing the available signal of interest by advanced MR acquisition methods, while also reducing the underlying noise floor, by modeling physiological noise and imperfections (artifacts) in functional MRI (fMRI) measurements. A key instrument for identifying and disentangling noise sources in this framework is the integration of independent measurements from contactless or peripheral sensors concurrent to the MR data collection, such as magnetic field probes, pulse plethysmographs or breathing belts.
