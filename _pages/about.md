## Welcome!

I am an MR physicist specializing in **fMRI**, with a particular focus on **physiological noise correction**, **magnetic field monitoring**, and **image reconstruction** and more than 15 years of experience in **ultra-high field** human MRI (7 Tesla). Currently, I am the **Lead MR Physicist** at the **[Toronto Neuroimaging Facility (ToNI)](https://toni.psych.utoronto.ca/)** in the Department of Psychology, University of Toronto.

My personal story through the lens of MRI can be found in this [ISMRM Member Spotlight](https://www.ismrm.org/member-spotlight/lars-kasper/) from 2023.

My core research interest is improving image and time series quality in MRI through understanding both numerator and denominator of the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., optimizing sampling in MRI, as well as characterizing and correcting for the various physiological and system-induced noise sources.
 
I am a fervent supporter of open and accessible neuroscience, and contribute through clean code in the form of usable toolboxes (PhysIO for physiological noise correction in fMRI, UniQC for unified image quality control in MR development) and workflows (GIRFReco.jl for image reconstruction with expanded signal models, as applied, e.g,. to spirals MR sequences). Furthermore, as a member of the equity, diversity and inclusivity (EDI) committee of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, I aim to improve accessibility for researchers with caregiver responsibilities.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on adapting state of the art advances in MR imaging methodology in the context of neuroscientific and translational MRI applications, Therein, I aim at increasing sensitivity from both angles, i.e., maximizing the available signal of interest by advanced MR acquisition methods, while also reducing the underlying noise floor, by modeling physiological noise and imperfections (artifacts) in functional MRI (fMRI) measurements. A key instrument for identifying and disentangling noise sources in this framework is the integration of independent measurements from contactless or peripheral sensors concurrent to the MR data collection, such as magnetic field probes, pulse plethysmographs or breathing belts.
